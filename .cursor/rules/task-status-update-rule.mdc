description: Always When updating the status of a task

    **STRICT RULES - MUST BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT EXCEPTION:**
    There is always exactly one task in either the in_progress or user_review state.
    Before updating the status, we guarantee that each condition is met.

    needsRefinment → in_progress conditions:
    ✅ Requirements have been sufficiently clarified and ready for implementation
    ✅ **Fully understand the code's dependencies and have already reviewed them**
    ✅ The impact on existing code has been assessed
    
    in_progress → user_review conditions:
    ✅ I explicitly checked that there were no compile errors
    ✅ Necessary tests have been added and all pass
    ✅ Required documentation updates are completed

    user_review → in_progress conditions:
    ✅ From feedback, the content to be modified is completely clear

    **user_review → completed conditions**:
    ✅ Only when explicitly approved by the user, absolutely.

    * → needsRefinment conditions:
    ✅ It becomes apparent that the task requirements are unclear or incomplete

    * → cancelled conditions:
    ✅ There is a clear reason why the task is no longer needed, or alternative methods or solutions to meet the requirements are clear
    ✅ The impact of cancellation on other related tasks has been evaluated
