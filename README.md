## Motivation

### Challenges with Coding Agents
- Coding agents often make modifications beyond what they're asked to do
    - Assuming cusor+claude
- They struggle to request user feedback at key decision points during implementation
- Work plans and progress tracking can be challenging to visualize and monitor

### Solution
- **Commit and PR-based Work Plans**: Force implementation plans that break down tickets into PRs and commits as the minimum units of work
- **Forced Frequent Feedback**: Enforce user reviews at the commit level, creating natural checkpoints for feedback
- **Visualization**: Instantly understand the current work plan and implementation status through a local React app

## tool

1. **Plan**: Define your implementation plan with PRs and commits
2. **Track**: Monitor progress and current status of all work items
3. **Update**: Change status as work progresses, with mandatory user reviews

## Visualization Dashboard

The project includes a React-based visualization tool that provides:

- Hierarchical view of PRs and commits
- Status-based color coding
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Real-time updates with auto-refresh
- Dark/light mode support
- Filtering options for complex work plans
